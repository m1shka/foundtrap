# Foundation 6 with Bootstrap-like styles

Foundation is the most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world. We all love the functionality, a large amount of plugins and pieces of code, BUT
In comparison with other css frameworks Foundation's design completely loses the game. Its a pity. That's why we copied some styles from worlds-largest bootstrap.


## Getting Started

This repo is a clone of [Foundation's](https://zurb.com/) last bild with customized settings.scss, and small edits in code.
In the root section index.html and kitchen.html are added. Watch these files for examples of Foundation new typography and components.
